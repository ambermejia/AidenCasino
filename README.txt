✨ This file is to explain some details of my assignment ✨

Card.java is a file to create a certain card as assignment asked 

Deck.java is a file to simulate all actions needed in a real card game
	particularly, I use an integer - cardNum to store how many cards have been drawn, 	to prevent the case that the user draws cards from a empty deck

Casino.java is a file with client code, which let the user play the games

	There are some few details about the games worth mention:

	1. User can input how much money does he or she have at the beginning of the game.
	2. In the war game, I consider the Ace is the largest card in the deck as in the 	reality, while I choose to ignore the difference between sets
	3. In the War game, if the value of two players are the same, the game is a tie. 	In this case, no one will lose money.
	4. In the game of BlackJack, I consider all Ace’s value should be 1.
	5. In the Casino game, the user is not allowed to borrow money, which means that 	they cannot bet money larger than what they have, as it add the risk of running a 	casino and it is bad for the harmony of families and social welfare.

Thank you ❤️
